Pedaliero
=========

Pedaliero is a simple program to send Raw HID packets via USB.

Developed for a teensy 2 (should work on other arduino board with minor tweakings)

Usage
-----

Either compile it yourself using the `make`, or directly flash the `pedaliero.hex` to your teensy.

You can plug up to 23 switches and 1 potentiometer in the F0 pin (if you find out how to modify my code to allow more analog inputs, please tell me !)
